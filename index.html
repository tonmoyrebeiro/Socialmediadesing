	<h1><i><u>Flag of Bangladesh</u></i></h1>

	<p>From its founding in 1949, the Awami League was the expression of Bengali nationalism in the territory then known as East Pakistan. Following elections in December 1970, which the league won, the military ruler of Pakistan canceled the National Assembly. Opposition to this by the Awami League led to the creation of a national flag for the Bengali homeland, Bangladesh. The flag of Bangladesh, like that of Pakistan, is dark green. This is a symbol of the Islamic faith of most of the population. Bengalis officially have a secular state, however, and therefore have defined the green as a symbol of the rich vegetation of their country and of the hope placed in their youth. <aside>The first flag, designed by a student named Serajul Alam, bore a red disk in the centre with a gold silhouette map of East Pakistan. When Mujibur Rahman (Sheikh Mujib), the leader of the Awami League, spoke out in favour of Bengali autonomy in March 1971, the new flag was displayed behind him. Pakistan soon undertook repressive measures and arrested Mujib, who responded by calling upon Bengalis to proclaim independence. With the support of Indian troops in December, the Bengalis were successful in their struggle, and a new government was proclaimed in January. On January 13, 1972, the national flag was modified. The silhouette map of the land was eliminated, and the red disk was shifted slightly off-centre toward the hoist. The symbolism of the red was defined as the blood shed by Bengalis in their fight for independence. The disk was said to be a symbol of â€œthe rising sun of a new country.</aside></p>
